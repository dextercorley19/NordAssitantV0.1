        The feeling of cruising the world&apos;s oceans should not be kept as a
        secret. Our mission at Nord Assistant is to break down the educational
        barriers to entry into owning or renting a yacht.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        One of the greatest joys of boating is experiencing adventure and
        visiting places only accessible by water. In order to accomplish this
        feat, learning how to safely maintain and operate your vessel is crucial
        to any adventure&apos;s success. Often bogged down by novel-length
        owners/operating manuals, confusing radio message formats, and ambiguous
        maintenance tracking, there can be a lot to learn and keep track of.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Nord Assistant offers an intuitive software ecosystem encompassing all
        the necessities in boating maintenance and operations. Every feature
        accessible through your new first mate: Nord. Nord is an AI chat
        interface that uses RAG to intelligently source through everything you
        provide in onboarding and add throughout use including: owners/operating
        manuals, maintenance history, trip logs, and ongoing notes.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        A typical captain&apos;s helm station usually holds a library of documents
        sourcing everything described above. Our goal with Nord is not to get
        rid of these but offer a service that helps you integrate and source
        through them quickly and in one place.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Our platform is useful for anyone including learning boaters, proficient
        captains, and charter owners. Book a demo and see how Nord can add to
        your adventure.
